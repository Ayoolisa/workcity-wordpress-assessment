# Short Answer Questions

## 1. Difference between Google Knowledge Graph and Google Knowledge Panel

- **Google Knowledge Graph**: A database of entities (people, places, organizations, things) and their relationships. It helps Google understand context and connections between entities.  
- **Google Knowledge Panel**: The visual display that appears in search results for a specific entity, showing key information from the Knowledge Graph, such as a summary, images, and links.

**In short**: The Knowledge Graph is the underlying database; the Knowledge Panel is the presentation of that data in search results.

## 2. How Google determines entity identity

Google determines entity identity by analyzing multiple data sources and signals, including:  
- Structured data (Schema.org markup) on websites.  
- Content context and relevance across the web.  
- Wikipedia, Wikidata, and other trusted knowledge sources.  
- User behavior and search patterns.  
- Cross-referencing information to disambiguate similar entities.

## 3. When to create Custom Post Types instead of pages

Custom Post Types (CPTs) are recommended when you need to manage content that has:  
- Repetitive or structured nature (e.g., portfolio items, products, events, testimonials).  
- Unique templates or display requirements different from standard pages or posts.  
- Taxonomies specific to a content type (categories, tags).  

**Use pages** for static content (e.g., About, Contact) and CPTs for structured, repeatable content.
